Data Types
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the difference between a primitive data type and a non-primitive data type in programming?
What are the primitive data types in your preferred programming language?
What is the difference between integer and floating-point data types?
What is a string data type? How is it different from a character data type?
What is the maximum and minimum value that can be stored in an integer data type in your preferred programming language?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operators
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the difference between the '==' and '===' operators in JavaScript?
What is the difference between the '&&' and '||' operators in programming?
What is the difference between a unary and a binary operator in programming?
What is the modulo operator (%) used for in programming?
What is the order of precedence for arithmetic operators in programming?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conditional Statements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the difference between 'if' and 'switch' statements in programming?
What is a ternary operator and how is it used in conditional statements?
What is the difference between '==', '!=', '>', '<', '>=' and '<=' operators used in conditional statements?
What is a nested if statement and how is it used in programming?
How can you simulate a switch-case statement using only if-else statements?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Looping Statements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop in programming?
How can you terminate a loop prematurely in programming?
What is an infinite loop and how can you avoid it in programming?
What is a do-while loop and how is it used in programming?
What is the difference between 'break' and 'continue' statements in programming?
